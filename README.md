# CafedirectProducersFoundation
data and code from the CafedirectProducersFoundation mini DataDive, Feb 2016

What is in this repo:
* KenyaClean.csv and UgandaClean.csv - the main, cleaned data for analysis
* DataDictionary - full documentation of each field, in .pdf and .xlsx format
* KenyaCleaning.R and UgandaCleaning.R - R scripts for converting the raw .csv files into the cleaned .csv files, using new column names from NewColumnNameMapping.csv
* Two .csv files with long names - these are the raw, un-edited data before cleaning
* NewColumnNameMapping.csv - this maps the old column names from the raw, un-edited data onto shorter new names.
* KenyaFirstLookv2 - in .Rmd and .pdf format, these contain some initial explorations of the raw data and were used early on to help determine what cleaning needed to be done
